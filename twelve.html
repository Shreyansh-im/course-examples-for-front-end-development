    <!-- Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is used to format the layout of a webpage.
 With CSS, you can control the color, font, the size of text, the spacing between elements,
 how elements are positioned and laid out, what background images or background colors are to be used,
 different displays for different devices and screen sizes, and much more! -->

<!-- CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:

Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements
Internal - by using a <style> element in the <head> section
External - by using a <link> element to link to an external CSS file
The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However, 
in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles, because this is easier to demonstrate,
 and easier for you to try it yourself. -->

 <!--An inline CSS is used to apply a unique style to a single HTML element.

An inline CSS uses the style attribute of an HTML element.

The following example sets the text color of the <h1> element to blue, 
and the text color of the <p> element to red:  -->

    
<h1 style="color:blue;">A Blue Heading</h1>

<p style="color:red;">A red paragraph.</p>

<!-- An internal CSS is used to define a style for a single HTML page.

An internal CSS is defined in the <head> section of an HTML page, within a <style> element.

The following example sets the text color of ALL the <h1> elements (on that page) to blue,
and the text color of ALL the <p> elements to red.
In addition, the page will be displayed with a "powderblue" background color:  -->
